Visual regression testing for Native iOS and Android apps with WebdriverIO

> This service works with WebdriverIO V7 and higher.

# What can it do

This service for WebdriverIO will add 4 methods that can be used to save and or check element/screen-shots of a native iOS or Android app, see [Methods](./README.md#methods) for all the methods and details.

When the compare methods are used a baseline image (each device + OS, and even OS version, needs to have it's own baseline image) will be compared to an actual screenshot.
The output will be an object of data, check the `save..`-methods output [here](https://github.com/wswebcreation/wdio-native-app-compare/blob/main/docs/METHODS.md#save-methods) and the `compare..`-methods [here](https://github.com/wswebcreation/wdio-native-app-compare/blob/main/docs/METHODS.md#compare-methods)

## Comparison

The images are compared with the lovely module [ResembleJS](https://github.com/rsmbl/Resemble.js).
If you want to compare images online, and thus by hand, you can check the [online tool](http://rsmbl.github.io/Resemble.js/)

Examples of saved images of elements / screens and diffs can be found [here](./docs/IMAGE-OUTPUT.md).

# Installation

## FAQ

### I get a console log when I try to save/compare an element screenshot on Android

When you are trying to save an element screenshot on Android the following log can be shown in your console

```bash
#####################################################################################
 AN ELEMENT SCREENSHOT COULD NOT BE TAKEN WITH THE NEW 'elementScreenshot()' METHOD,
 A FALLBACK HAS BEEN EXECUTED AND THE ELEMENT WILL BE SAVED.
 USE 'automationName: "UiAutomator2"' FOR ANDROID TO FULLY USE THE POWER OF APPIUM
#####################################################################################
```

Please make sure you are using the `UiAutomator2`-driver when automating with Appium, see the Appium docs [here](http://appium.io/docs/en/drivers/android-uiautomator2/)

## element screenshot on an iPhone 11 are borken

There seems to be an issue with Appium and the iPhone 11 not giving back a correct element screenshot.
I need to investigate this better, but a workaround would be to provide an empty `resizeDimensions`-object like this

    driver.compareElement($('element'),'name', {resizeDimensions:{}});

This will trigger taking an element screenshot by cutting it out a large screenshot.

## Credits

-   Credits go out to Tele2 Netherlands. They gave me the awesome assignment to automate a React Native app and also gave me the space to investigate the tools I needed to use to automate a React Native app.
-   Also the WebdriverIO team and the WebdriverIO community. The tool is really awesome and easy to use and the support is really awesome!
